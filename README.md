# Discourse code-block line numbers
This component adds automatic line numbers to code blocks in Discourse, for blocks of two or more lines. Inline code, blocks of 1 line and onebox code blocks are not affected. 
It will also allow you to add a header title bar to codeblocks, and change the font size.
